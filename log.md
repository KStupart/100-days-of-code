# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a Python Web Scraper Application.

**Thoughts:** Holy Cow this was off to a slow start! From figuring out which Python version I had installed (It was 3) to trying to understand which terminal to use the command 'pip install' I have to say I was fairly disgruntled and discouraged. After much googling however, this [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_ACbv4329E) really aided me.
