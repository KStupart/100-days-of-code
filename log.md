# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a Python Web Scraper Application.

**Thoughts:** Holy Cow this was off to a slow start! From figuring out which Python version I had installed (It was 3) to trying to understand which terminal to use the command 'pip install' I have to say I was fairly disgruntled and discouraged. After much googling however, this [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_ACbv4329E) really aided me. I followed this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/) and I think I'll call it a ~3 hours~ day!

### Day 2: August 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Public Key Encryption App

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately I missed yesterday, but that's no reason to give up! I got back on my feet today and started a Public Key Encryption App. As it is, I need to finish it and then do some more debugging but I'm proud of my progress

### Day 3: August 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Public Key Encryption App

**Thoughts**: I started the challenge a lot earlier today and I'm proud of that! My Public Key App now accepts user input and I updated the project's readme file to display a screenshot of what the program can do so far.

### Day 4: August 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Public Key Encryption App

**Thoughts**: I started the challenge at the usual late time today. I feel a heck of a lot more confident with ArrayLists now and I'm glad that I pushed through and started coding even though I'm tired.
